* Always Work One Task at a Time

We all know the talent of multi-tasking is always a plus. However, when you are working your way through something that is challenging and needs that extra focus, not so much.
Until you are truly comfortable with what you are doing stick to working through a single task a time. This helps avoid confusion and causing yourself to backtrack.
If the need occurs you can also write yourself a list.

* Take Breaks!

It is essential to your mental health and development when learning a MASSIVE amount of things to take breaks. When you feel like you are at a standstill or are feeling overwhelmed take a minute to yourself. 
Not only does this give your mind a break, but you also come back refreshed and ready to hit the ground running. Your codes won't be going anywhere I promise.

* GOOGLE!

During the process of working through whatever project or lesson, it is before you ask for help try Google. Not only will this help you work through the problem yourself but you will also learn some keywords and phrases to find the best results. Google is how I have found my favorite sources and teachers. 

* Develop Problem-Solving Skills

Coding is essentially constant problem-solving. You can do many activities to help those skills grow. Using challenging gameplay is often a great development tool. Sudoku is always a great go-to, every level is different and there any many different versions of it.

* Go With the Flow

Technology is constantly changing, familiarize yourself with those changes as much as possible. When these changes occur it is best to find the method that works best with these changes and use them.

* Learn to Accept Your Failures

Every programmer fails, some more than others. If you embrace those failures you can use them as learning tools. For every failure, you overcome there will be 10 more accomplishments. Embrace your failures as a learning step and keep going!
