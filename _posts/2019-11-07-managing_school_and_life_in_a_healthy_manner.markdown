This past month I had a PTSD and had to learn the hard way of learning when your health and schoolwork run into the same path.
A part of PTSD is learning when your mental health is needing some TLC and having the new involvement of school represents a new challenge in managing this. Coming from someone who has learned the hard way, learn to recognize when you need the help.
The stress and lack of sleep from the mental struggles was making it impossible to focus on my schoolwork and I was having a difficult time recognizing that I needed to take a step back and breath. Thanks to the amazing Flatiron support team they provide us with I got the back up needed to adjust my course and focus on getting myself back together.
Understanding the importance of balancing our school, work, homelife, and mental health is a struggle however, by learning to trust and listen to yourself before you get caught up can prevent problems for yourself.
