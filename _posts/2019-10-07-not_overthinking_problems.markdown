Over time working through the labs I have had to teach myself not to overthink when I come across a code that is not working.
I have developed a tendency of having one wrong step in a code I have written and instead of analyzing the code simply, I have been picking apart every bit of the written codes.
To discipline myself not to do this I have written a reminder post it attached to my laptop screen and practiced reading the error within the code. For someone who is a perfectionist this has been one of the most difficult parts of working through my labs, as I always think of everything I do as something that needs to be improved.
Throughout the processes of working through each lab I've had to consistently remind myself that not everything is perfect and making mistakes along the way is normal.
Working hard to excel in something should involve mistakes and always remember that even the experts have learning curves.
