The approach of a big project can be daunting. However, with the proper preparation it can be made easier.

1. Your first approach should be to understand what the subject of the project will be.
2. If there are licensing, practices, or policies to be kept to it is best to make yourself aware of them.
3. Choose your tools! When working with a multi-dimensional project make sure you either know or find the best tools to ensure the needs to complete your project can be met.
4. Create a system for yourself to work through your project. This will make problem solving and making it through each process easier.
5. Work through your list of items to complete and change the process as needed.

Have fun and learn as you go!!!
