One of the most challenging things in completing a lab in a subject that is new to you can be finding resources to assist you in finding solutions.

When finding a solution to an error it is quite often best to looking up the name of the error itself, and others it can be keywords from the errors summary. Using these keywords is also an option into the search bar on Youtube as well.

Similar techniques apply when you are searching for assistance in a solution to a method that is new to you. It does help narrow down that search when adding the language you are searching for the key to solve the solution you are working.

Knowing the right ways and right sources to find the help you need can make the difference in how fast and how clean you can code your way to success.

Here are some excellent sources for Ruby programming that you can turn to when the help is needed:
