Software development is a rigorous and hands on career base. It is consistently changing and full of new challenges.
I wanted to work to build a career that not only I but, my son can be proud of. As a single mother I have been stuck in a hourly clock in- clock out job that does not provide any true self growth or opportunity.

I enjoy being able to dig into a program and having the opportunity to create and change things that everyone can use.  The world of software and technology is constantly transforming and there are few things more exciting than being one of those hands of change in the world. 

As a single parent I am holding the torch of the main influence in my child's life. So much like the software development world that I am learning to move and grow with, my growth will influence his growth now and in the future.

I have chosen software development because it is exciting as well as challenging. However, I have also chosen it as a challenge to better my future and the futures of the lives my work and fellow software developers will touch.
